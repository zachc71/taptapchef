# 🎮 Game Design Document: Tap Tap Chef

## Overview

**Tap Tap Chef** is a casual clicker game where players tap to cook meals, earn cash, automate kitchen functions, and ultimately scale a single food stall into a cosmic food empire.

### Design Goals:
- Keep gameplay loop simple but deeply upgradeable
- Create a sense of exponential growth (local → global → galactic)
- Blend humor and existential scale in a satirical, engaging tone
- Easy monetization through rewarded ads and cosmetic/IAP systems

---

## 🧠 Core Loop

1. **Tap to Cook**
2. **Earn Cash**
3. **Upgrade Kitchen / Hire Staff**
4. **Unlock New Kitchen / Restaurant**
5. **Prestige for Multipliers**
6. **Repeat with Higher Tiers**

---

## 🍔 Core Systems

### 1. **Tapping & Income System**
- Every tap = 1 meal served
- Base cash per tap scales with dish tier
- Combo multipliers for tap streaks (optional phase 2)

### 2. **Kitchen Upgrades**
| Upgrade        | Effect                        | Cost Type |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------|
| Frying Speed   | Reduce time per tap           | Cash      |
| Meal Quality   | Increase $ per tap            | Cash      |
| Max Inventory  | Boost earnings per idle tick  | Cash      |

### 3. **Automation (Staff Hiring)**
- Staff automate taps at fixed intervals
- Upgradable staff speed & effectiveness
- Unlock new roles (Cook, Server, Manager, Robot Chef)

### 4. **Idle Progression**
- Background income accumulates at slower rate
- Capped based on kitchen inventory or staff efficiency

### 5. **Prestige System (Catering Contracts)**
- Reset progress in exchange for Prestige Points (PP)
- PP can be spent on permanent multipliers, global upgrades, or unlocks
- Unlock new food tiers (cosmic recipes, quantum ingredients)
